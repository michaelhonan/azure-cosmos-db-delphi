# azure-cosmos-db-delphi
Small project showing how to generate the HMAC signature for CosmosDB Authorization

It took me too long to figure out how to do all this, so here you go. I've tested this solution in XE5, and also the latest Delphi 11.1.

Code is based on the instructions from the Microsoft docs, and I've included the same sample that they use in their sample code.

*Note: Any keys included in this project are sample keys obtained from Microsofts documentation*

Cheers.
